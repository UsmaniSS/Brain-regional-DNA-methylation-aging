# Hypothalamic-DNA-Methylation-Aging-Neurodegeneration
This repository contains code from a study on age-related DNA methylation in the hypothalamus of male mice, comparing hippocampus and olfactory brain regions. Key findings include significant methylation differences, involvement of OXT and GnRH pathways, and potential interventions for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s.
